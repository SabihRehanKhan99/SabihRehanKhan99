Got it 👍 — thanks for the patience.
You want a **GitHub profile README.md**, **similar in structure and vibe** to the **introductory README on sarimkd’s GitHub**, but **100% tailored to YOU and your CV**.

Below is a **ready-to-paste `README.md`** you can put in a repo named exactly **`sabihrehan`** (same name as your GitHub username). GitHub will automatically show it on your profile.
